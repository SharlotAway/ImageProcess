# Down Sampling and Up Sampling with Filters

To run our code, create an environment first.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

We packed downsampling methods and upsampling methods respectively in `downsample` and `upsample` folder, and filters in `filters` folder. To customize these algorithms, you can open the folder to tune hyper parameters.

Also you can train learanale upsampling methods with the scripts in jupyters in each folder.
