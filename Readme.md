# Down Sampling and Up Sampling with Filters

This report evaluates image upsampling and downsampling methods. Given an input image, we perform sequential 1/2 downsampling and 2Ã— upsampling to generate a reconstructed image, aiming to identify the combination that minimizes reconstruction error. We tested classical algorithms (nearest-neighbor, bilinear, bicubic interpolation) and found bilinear downsampling + bicubic upsampling delivers minimal error across various images. Performance was evaluated using MSE, PSNR, SSIM and LPIPS metrics. Implementation used Python with, main dependencies include PIL, NumPy, and PyTorch.

## Environment
To run our code, create an environment first.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:SharlotAway/ImageProcess.git
cd ImageProcess
conda create -n sample python=3.10 -y
conda activate sample
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Methods
We packed 12 downsampling methods and 8 upsampling methods respectively in `downsample` and `upsample` folder, and 8 filters (3 frequency domain and 5 spatial domain) in `filters` folder. To customize these algorithms, you can open the folder to tune hyper parameters.Also you can train learanale upsampling methods with the scripts in jupyters in each folder.

## Dataset
Download DIV2K dataset from this [link](https://data.vision.ee.ethz.ch/cvl/DIV2K/) into `./dataset` folder in seperate folders. Then you can use this at wherever in the reposity by direct to the path.
